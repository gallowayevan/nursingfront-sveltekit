export default `Data, except for retention, is for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who graduated between 2013 and 2016. Each marker on the map indicates the approximate (zip code level) practice location of each nurse two years after graduating from a nursing education program.  If the number of graduates for this time period was less than 20, then data for that program is not reported here. The licensure data used for this analysis is from the North Carolina Board of Nursing.
Work setting is self-reported. The map shows either all nurses or only those working in a hospital setting because the number of nurses in other settings is often very low for a given program.
Retention data is from NC Tower, a product of the North Carolina Common Follow-up System, which reports on the in-state employment for graduates of public universities and community colleges. The data reported here is for nurses who graduated between 2010 and 2017. We calculated the percentage employed in North Carolina two years after graduation. For the both the Region A and the Foothills Nursing Consortiums, data from the individual consortium members, as reported in the NC Tower data, were aggregated to the consortium level. For instance, graduates of the Isothermal Community College Associate's Degree in Nursing program are reported here as part of the Foothills Nursing Consortium.`
