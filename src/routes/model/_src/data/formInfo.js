    ["type", "Select either Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs) or Registered Nurses (RNs)."],
    ["education", "This refers to the basic education for licensure. For registered nurses, you can select either those nurses who entered with an associate degree/diploma or with a BS or MS. For licensed practical nurses, this option is unavailable. You cannot select both an education subgroup and a setting subgroup for the same projection (e.g., BS & MS for Education and Hospital for Setting)."],
    ["rateOrTotal", "Select whether you want to see the nurse workforce as a total number or as a rate per 10,000 population. The latter is more useful for comparing different geographic areas."],
    ["fteOrHeadcount", "The model can display the projections for nurses as either full time equivalents (FTEs) or as headcounts. FTEs account for nurses who may be working less than full-time. 1 FTE = 40 hours/week, and no nurse has greater than 1 FTE."],
    ["locationType", "Select a geographic category or type. This selection changes the available options for location."],
    ["location", "Select a geography or location. These options change based on the selection of Location Type."],
    ["setting", "See the nurse workforce by practice setting, e.g., hospital or ambulatory care. You cannot select both an education subgroup and a setting subgroup for the same projection (e.g., BS & MS for Education and Hospital for Setting)."],
    ["scenario", "Select a scenario to see how it changes the projections."],
    ["calculation", `Select 'Supply' or 'Demand' to see those projections alone. Selecting 'Supply / Demand' will show both projections as a ratio. Selecting 'Supply - Demand' will show both the absolute difference between the two projections.`],
    ["difference", "The absolute difference between the supply and demand forecasts, calculated as supply minus demand for a give year. This calculation provides an estimate of the absolute number of nurses in surplus or shortage. It is important to note the overall numbers of nurses for a given projection when interpreting these values, e.g., a shortage of 1,000 nurses is much more concerning if you are looking at an underlying supply of 10,000 vs 100,000."],
    ["ratio", "The ratio between the supply and demand forecasts. When this is less than 1, it means demand is greater than supply. The calculation is useful for understanding the relative surplus or shortage for a projection."],
    ["supply", "The supply model projects the future headcount and FTE of RNs and LPNs from 2018-2030. The basic principle of supply modeling is to take the current workforce, subtract leavers and add joiners for each year to generate a forecast for the next year."],
    ["demand", "Demand was modeled at the county-level for each setting. Different approaches for calculating forecast demand were used as a result of the variation in data measuring existing demand. The demand forecast for public and community health, nursing education, and correctional facilities was solely dependent on population change (which means a 10% growth in population would generate a 10% growth in demand). For the remaining settings, separate regression models were developed to predict demand based on model predictors (e.g. gender, age, race) specific to that setting."]
